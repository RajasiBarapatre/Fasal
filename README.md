An AI-powered Digital Twin for smarter farming decisions

Instead of only detecting disease, the system simulates future outcomes of multiple treatment actions and recommends the most profitable and sustainable choice.
Each farm field is represented as a Digital Twin Card that models crop condition, disease severity, soil health, crop stage, and weather.
The AI twin predicts how the crop might evolve under different actions, such as no treatment, chemical spraying, or low-cost alternatives and compares their yield impact, cost, and ROI.
The farmer receives a clear, prescriptive recommendation, not generic advice, in her regional language.
